The objective of this project is to demonstrate and enhance the safety capabilities of a UR20 Cobot arm by integrating various components, including a conveyor belt, a photo-eye sensor, end-effector (gripper), a laser safety scanner, a human proximity detecting camera, and a host PC. The integration aims to facilitate the safe operation of a palletizing robot while conforming to safety standards that allow workers to perform tasks around the robot.

Currently, the work cell lacks the necessary components and configurations to operate efficiently and safely in a dynamic environment. The project will focus on developing a robust control application that not only enables the desired palletizing operation but also incorporates critical safety features, including safety cutoffs and presence
detection. This integration is vital to minimize operational risks and enhance productivity within the work cell.

By addressing these goals, the project aims to enable the UR20 Collaborative Robot to function as a highly capable, safe, and efficient automated solution for industrial applications.
