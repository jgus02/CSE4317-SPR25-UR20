The UR20 Cobot robot is the 6-axis robotic system that has been chosen for this project. its payload capacity of 20 kg and reach of 1750 mm makes it suitable for industrial palletizing tasks. The goal is to program the robot to demonstrate how a truly cooperative industrial robot could be utilized in industry, specifically for palletizing transportation cargo.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rotational Axes: the robots rotational axes allow for precise motion and coordination
    \item Safety Sensors: the UR20 is equipped with a LIDAR sensor that detects presence within its working range
    \item Emergency Stop Button: Included in the Teaching Pendant, this causes the UR20 to halt its movements instantly to prevent injuries
    \item Programming Sequences: the UR20 programming involves a predefined sequence of stages. it calibrates itself before following a pre-determined set of steps.
    \item Conveyor belt: The conveyor belt delivers boxes to the gripper, stopping when a box is in the correct location
    \item Photoeye sensor: Determines when the conveyor belt should stop by detecting a box at the end of the belt
\end{itemize}
