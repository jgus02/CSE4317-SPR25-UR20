The UR20 palletizing system is designed to automate the process of stacking uniform-sized boxes on pallets. The system consists of multiple layers that interact through the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), which manages the UR20 robotic arm, safety sensors, conveyor belt, and laser based object detection. 

This document is built upon the System Requirements Specification (SRS) and Architectural Design Specification (ADS) to define the functional and structural design decisions. For a comprehensive understanding of the system's high-level requirements and architectural framework refer to the SRS and the ADS, which serve as the foundation for the detailed design decisions presented in this specification.
